This is the source code for the Arduino OBD-II data logger, which displays (on a 320x240 TFT LCD shield) and records (to a SD card) a selected set of OBD-II data.

To compile the code with Arduino IDE, please copy all library files from the libraries directory to Arduino's libraries directory.

To open the project file (obdlogger.cbp), please download CodeBlocks Arduino Edition (http://www.arduinodev.com/codeblocks).
